README MinMon package 

The Minimization Monitor (MinMon) provides a means to visualize and report 
on the performance of the GSI minimization function.  The package 
is supported on wcoss2, hera, orion, hercules, cheyenne, jet, and s4 machines.

The package is organized in two main processes: data_extract and image_gen 
(image generation).  The data extract piece is now located in the 
global-workflow repository and must be run as part of the vrfy job.  To 
run it ensure your expdir/*/config.vrfy file includes this line:

   export VRFYMIN="YES".


To use the package:

1.  Run GSI-monitor/ush/build.sh.  This builds all necessary executables.

2.  The GSI-monitor sets default values for necessary storage, work, and log file 
locations in GSI-monitor/parm/Mon_config.  If you want to override the defaults
the important settings are: 

tankdir  -- the location for extracted data storage
ptmp     -- log file location
stmp     -- work space
WEBUSER  -- user name on web server (emcrzdm)

Note that these locations  are set for each machine.

In src/Minimization_Monitor/parm/MinMon_user_settings:

DO_ERROR_RPT -- switch controling data reporting (warnings).
MAIL_TO      -- email address to which warnings will be sent.

3.  Once you've run an experiment using global-workflow, extracted data should be in 
your comrot/$PSLOT directory.  You can leave the data there or move it to your 
$TANKDIR.  If you leave it in place you will have to specify the location for the 
image generation and web site create scripts below.  If you would like to move the 
data to your $TANKDIR location use this script: 

GSI-monitor/src/Minimization_Monitor/data_extract/ush/MinMon_CP.sh 

4.  There is no automatic web site generation script available (yet).  The necessary files
to construct a web site are located in GSI-monitor/src/Minimization_Monitor/image_gen/html.  
If you have any questions about this please contact me (edward.safford@noaa.gov).

5.  Run the image generation.  Navigate to GSI-monitor/src/Minimization_Monitor/image_gen/ush
and run:

 ./MinMon_Plt.sh suffix -p|--pdate -r|--run -t|--tank

	suffix       $NET value or the name of your parallel.  
        -p|--pdate   Cycle time for which you wish to generate images. It must be in
                        YYYYMMDDHH format.  This is the FINAL cycle for which images
                        will be generated (i.e. plot pdate and ncyc cycles before it).
        -r|--run     $RUN value --  gdas (default) or gfs.
        -n|--ncyc    Number of cycles to be used in time-series plots.  If not
                        specified the default value of 120 cycles is used.
        -t|--tank    Location of the extracted data files.  This is likely to be your 
                        comrot/$PSLOT directory.  This is only needed if your extraction
                        was via global-workflow and data has NOT been copied to $TANKDIR.

6.  If you're running on wcoss2 MinMon_Plt.sh will move the generated image files to the web 
server (emcrzdm), provided you have password free access set up for your user account. 

On all other machines you will have to manually move files from your $TANKDIR/imgn/$NET/$RUN/minmon
directory to the server.
