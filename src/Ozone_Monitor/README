README OznMon package 

The OznMon (ozone monitoring) package can be used to extract information
from ozone diagnostic files and generate image plots to visualize the results.
The package also may optionally perform data validation and error checking.
The package is supported on wcoss2, hera, hercules, orion, cheyenne, jet, and s4 
machines.

The package is organized in two processes, the data_extract and image_gen 
(image generation).  There is also an nwprod directory, which contains the lower 
level components of the data_extract portion.  The J-job, scripts, and ush scripts
which used to be in the nwprod directory have been moved to the global-workflow
repository and must be run as part of the vrfy job in global-workflow.


To use the package:

1.  Run GSI-monitor/ush/build.sh.  This builds all necessary executables.

2.  The GSI-monitor sets default values for necessary storage, work, and log file 
locations in GSI-monitor/parm/Mon_config.  If you want to override the defaults
the important settings are: 

tankdir  -- the location for extracted data storage
ptmp     -- log file location
stmp     -- work space
WEBUSER  -- user name on web server (emcrzdm)

Note that these locations are set for each machine.

In src/Ozone_Monitor/parm/OznMon_user_settings:

DO_DATA_RPT -- switches on/off data reporting (warnings).
MAIL_TO     -- specifies the email address to which warning reports will be sent.

3.  To perform OznMon data extraction as part of the vrfy job in the global-workflow
    make sure your expdir/*/config.vrfy file contains this line:

         export VRFYOZN="YES"
   
    The extracted data should be in your comrot/$PSLOT directory. 

4.  There is no automatic web site generation script available (yet).  The necessary files
to construct a web site are located in GSI-monitor/src/Ozone_Monitor/image_gen/html.
If you have any questions about this please contact me (edward.safford@noaa.gov).

5.  Run the image generation.  Navigate to GSI-monitor/src/Ozone_Monitor/image_gen/ush
and run:

 ./OznMon_Plt.sh suffix -p|--pdate -r|--run -n|--ncyc -t|--tank

	suffix       $NET value or the name of your parallel.  
        -p|--pdate   Cycle time for which you wish to generate images.  It must be
                        in YYYYMMDDHH format.  This is the FINAL cycle for which images
                        will be generated (i.e. pdate and ncyc cycles before it).
        -r|--run     $RUN value -- gdas (default) or gfs.
        -n|--ncyc    Number of cycles to be used in time-series plots.  If not
                        specified the default value of 120 cycles is used.
        -t|--tank    Location of the extracted data files.  This is likely to be your 
                        comrot/$PSLOT directory.  This is only needed if your extraction
                        was via global-workflow and NOT copied to $TANKDIR.


6.  Move the data and html files to the web server (emcrzdm).  If you're on wcoss2 and have
password free access to web server set up for your user account, then run OznMon_Transfer.sh to 
push the data files to the server.

On all other machines you will have to manually move files from your $TANKDIR/imgn/$NET/$RUN/radmon
directory to the server.

  ./OznMon_Transfer.sh OZNMON_SUFFIX -r|run 
         -r|--run gdas|gfs to include in file paths.  Default is gdas.

If you encounter problems please send me contact and I'll be glad to help:
